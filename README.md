# simple-des-encrypt-decrypt
Encrypts user input into 8-bit ciphertext for each character inputted. Can also decrypt ciphertext back into message.

This program tests the DES (Data Encryption Standard) symmetric encryption algorithm using a simplified version known as the "Simple DES Algorithm," which features a 10-digit key rather than a 56-bit key.

DES was developed at IBM in the early '70s, but has since been replaced by much more secure algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

The "with bonus" .cpp file is the one that allows decrypting 8-bit ciphertext. Running it provides a menu to encrypt and decrypt.

First, try to encrypt a word, such as "book". The program will output a series of ciphertext.

In the menu, you can then choose decrypt, enter the ciphertext character by character, and it will convert it back into the message.
