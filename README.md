# simple-des-encrypt-decrypt
Encrypts user input into 8-bit ciphertext for each character inputted. Can also decrypt ciphertext back into message.

The "with bonus" .cpp file is the one that allows decrypting 8-bit ciphertext. Running it provides a menu to encrypt and decrypt.

First, try to encrypt a word, such as "book". The program will output a series of ciphertext.

In the menu, you can then choose decrypt, enter the ciphertext character by character, and it will convert it back into the message.
